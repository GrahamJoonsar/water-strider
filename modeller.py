# Using photogrammetry, autonomously create a scaled 3D model of the coral restoration area – up to 40 points
# ○ Create a 3D model of the coral restoration area – 20 points
# ○ Measure the length of the coral restoration area (within 5 cm) – 10 points
# ○ Scale the 3D model using the length of the coral restoration area – 5 points
# ○ Use the properly scaled 3D model to estimate the height of the coral restoration area (within 5 cm) – 5 points
